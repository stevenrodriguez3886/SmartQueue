Many small to medium sized services such as clinics, offices, and government service centers all had struggle with long wait times, overcrowded waiting areas, and inefficient appointment management.
Customers often arrive without knowing how long they might have to wait, which could lead to frustration from the customer or missed appointments.
Staff members also face such difficulties managing walk-ins, cancellations, and schedules changes in real time. 
This problem can be experienced by customers who waste time waiting and receive little visibility into service delays, staff who rely on manual/outdated scheduling systems, and companies that suffer from inefficiencies and poor customer experiences.
The reason why this problem is worth solving is because long wait times can negatively impact productivity and customer satisfaction. A smart, adaptive system can reduce congestion, improve transparency, and optimize resource allocation. By using Agile development techniques, the system can be incrementally improved based on user feedback, ensuring it meets real-world needs while being able to be flexible with change.

The proposed solution is Smart Queue, a cloud-based mobile application designed to manage appointments and virtual queues in real time.
The system allows customers to schedule appointments, join a virtual waiting list, and view estimated wait times remotely that helps reduce the need for physical waiting areas.

What Smart Queue can provide in terms of value is by: 
•	Improving customer experience through reduce wait times and timely notifications.
•	Increasing operational efficiency for service providers by automating scheduling, dynamically handling walk-ins, and reduce no-shows.
•	Enabling data collecting decisions through real-time analytics on wait times, heavy hours, and service performance. 

Target Users/Stakeholders
The system is designed to support multiple user groups with each having a distinct role and needs.
Primary users are customers/clients and staff. For customers/clients, are individuals who schedule appointments, join virtual queues, receive notifications, and view estimated wait times. For staff, are employees who serve customers and update queue status and appointment progress. 
Secondary users are administrators who are responsible for configuring service, managing schedules, and generating reports. 
Stakeholders can be business owners and IT (Information technology). For business owners, are interested in improved efficiency, reduction of no-shows, and improved customer satisfaction. For IT, are responsible for system maintenance, security, and integration with existing systems.
